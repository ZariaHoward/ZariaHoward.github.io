        Our data comes from the photographer Teenie Harris who's archive is currently held by the Carnegie Museum of Art. His work comprises of approximately 80000 images, 60885 of which have been collected, scanned, and sampled for the research on this site. 

    	The first investigation into the Teenie Harris archive is to see the general format of his picture by scanning the archive for the aspect ratios that Teenie Harris uses. To understand his compositions you need to know the canvas that he is building off of. The most frequent ratio was 0.79 which means most of his photos have a 4:5 aspect ratio. The second most frequent (but significantly less frequent) ratio was 0.75 which means some of his photos have a 4:3 aspect ratio.

    	Teenie Harris only owned two cameras in his lifetime despite being one of the most prominent photographers in Pittsburgh. This fact alone explains why only two aspect ratios appear in the data. We know that his first camera was the Rolleicord medium-format camera that he used to make the 4:5 photos. He used this camera at his photographic studio at 2128 Centre Avenue in the Hill District until approximately the 1970s. The photos that stick out in the data are the 13 out of 18000 that are perfectly square. 

    	(put square photos) --- make some insight their significance here

		Also, through this initial scan of the photos I found that 18546 photos are oriented vertically (31.3%) and 40719 photos are oriented horizontally (68.7%). Teenie Harris has a strong preference towards posed group photos as opposed to portraits which definitely influences this ratio. Additionally most of his photographs of crowds and large events also are horizontal.
