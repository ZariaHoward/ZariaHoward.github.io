        This investigation into the Teenie Harris archive is to see the general format of his photos by scanning the collection for the widths and heights of each photo.

        The photos were taken by the photographer Teenie Harris, whos collection is currently held by the Carnegie Museum of Art. As a lead photographer for the Pittsburgh Courier, he chronicled Black life in the Hill District of Pittsburgh more comprehensively than any other photoset focused on black urban life. His work comprises of approximately 80000 images, 60885 of which have been collected, scanned, and sampled for the research on this site. 

    	 The width to height aspect ratio can heavily influence how a photo's composition is made.  The bar graphs below show a distribution of those ratios as well as their corresponding orientation. 172 (1%) photos were square , 14564 (31%) were vertical, and 31814 (68%) were horizontal.

        According to the charts, the most frequent ratio was 0.79 which means most of his photos have a 4:5 aspect ratio. The second most frequent (but significantly less frequent) ratio was 0.75 which means some of his photos have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Teenie Harris only owned two cameras in his lifetime despite being one of the most prominent photographers in Pittsburgh. This fact alone explains why only two aspect ratios appear in the data. We know that his first camera was the Rolleicord medium-format camera that he used to make the 4:5 photos. He used this camera at his photographic studio at 2128 Centre Avenue in the Hill District until approximately the 1970s.

<br>
<br>
    	Overall from this information we can conclude that we have 5 different types of photos: vertical and horizontal 4:3 photos, vertical and horizontal 4:5 photos, as well as square photos. Each type lends itself to different patterns. For example, Teenie Harris took a large amount of group shots at major events for the Pittsburgh Courier. This type of photo natural lends itself to a horizontal orientation. Likewise, almost all of his square photos feature one person sitting up straight, tall, and centered like the classic yearbook photo.

        This information allows us to look at content in the photographs relative to the borders, which is a good foundation for the rest of the investigations.
