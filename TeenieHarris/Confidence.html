    	The confidence in the results in analyzing composition in photo heavily depends on how much confidence we can have in the subjects of the photo that we picked up. The facial recognition library that was used to detect faces in the library gives a confidence metric which tells us the probability that the pixels detected are actually a human face. The face sizes retrieved from the library are fixed and discrete.

    	The majority of the faces detected are small, this is most likely an artifact of the fact that most of Teenie's photos are group pictures and crowd shots. The more people he fit into a photo, the smaller everyone's faces were. However in his portrait photographs with one or two people the faces seemed to be significantly larger.

		 Faces that are bigger in the photo almost always have a higher confidence associated with them. Faces that are smaller have a confidences anywhere from 0 to 1.2, the variance is greater in small faces.

		<br>

		As you can see in the chart above, it was rare to have a large face and a low confidence. Even the faces with low confidences such as 0.2 are still faces and no number is a cutoff threshold for what makes the face detection library accurate as you can see below:
		(show a low confidence face, show a face that doesn't look like a face as well) and a (high confidence face) (use the confidence sorting pdf that you had).  The most frequent confidence level was 1.05 which is very high and in those photos the face is clear an unobstructed.

		All in all, moving forward we can be confident that the faces found and analyzed by the detector aren't false positives, or results that have to be parsed through which will come in handy when looking at how faces affect the rest of the composition.
