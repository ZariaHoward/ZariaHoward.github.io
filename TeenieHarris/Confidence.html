    	The confidence in the results in analyzing composition in photo heavily depends on how much confidence we can have in the subjects of the photo that we picked up. The facial recognition library that was used to detect faces in the library gives a confidence metric which tells us the probability that the pixels detected are actually a human face. Frequently, if a face is bigger in a photo it's easier to detect human features so it's also important to look at the distribution of face sizes picked up as well.

		Results:
		<ul>
			<li>The most frequent confidence level was 1.05 which is a very high confidence. Anything below 0.9 isn't absolute.</li>
			<li>Oftentimes, even faces with confidences as low as 0.3 still were actually faces, I could not find any false positives</li>
			<li>The confidence is normally distributed. The distribution has a mean of 0.98 with a standrd deviation of 0.22</li>
			<li>The face sizes retrieved from the library are fixed and discrete. This is a result of the library </li>
			<li>The ratio of small faces to large faces is very small, which is an effect of the fact that the majority of his photos are group shots and public events</li>
			<li>Faces take up approximately 1.09% of the pixels in the whole collection.</li>
			<li>Faces that are bigger in the photo almost always have a high confidence associated with them. Faces that are smaller have a confidences anywhere from 0 to 1.2, the variance is greater in small faces. </li>
		</ul>
