<h1> Research Teenie Harris </h1>
<h2> By Zaria Howard</h2>


Charles "Teenie" Harris (1908â€“1998) was a photographer who captured black urban community in Pittsburgh from 1935 to 1975. He was one of the principal photographers for one of the nation's most influential black newspapers, Pittsburgh Courier. The Carnegie Museum of Art archived nearly 80,000 of his images and the photographic dataset is one of the "most detailed and intimate records" of the black urban experience known today. Additionally, because Teenie was such a talented photographer, the archive is more than a historical artifact, his style and compositional signiture is a reflection of the art and photography of that time period. I plan on using statistics,computer vision, and machine learning to hopefully bring forth a more holistic view of Teenie's archive.
