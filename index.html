<h1> Research Teenie Harris </h1>
<h2> By Zaria Howard</h2>


Charles "Teenie" Harris (1908â€“1998) was a Black photographer who captured black urban community in Pittsburgh from 1935 to 1975. The Carnegie Museum of Art archived nearly 80,000 of his images and the photographic dataset is one of the "most detailed and intimate records" of the black urban experience known today. One of the greater challenges of the archive is the sheer size of it. Finding common faces, spotting multiple photos of the same event, figuring out the connections between the photos can be difficult if there are 80,000. Additionally, because Teenie was such a talented photographer, people are interested in his style and what he brings to each photo in terms of composition. On this blog I plan to address many of these issues using statistics,computer vision, and machine learning to hopefully bring forth a more holistic view of Teenie's archive.
